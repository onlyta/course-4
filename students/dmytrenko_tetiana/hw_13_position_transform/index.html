                        <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment
                            setup instructions, they&rsquo;ve moved to <ins>their own section</ins>. Continue reading

                        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using
                            React and the app platform&rsquo;s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript
                            to
                            access your platform&rsquo;s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your
                            UI
                            using React components: <i>bundles of reusable, nestable code</i>. You can learn more
                            about React
                            in the next section. But first, let&rsquo;s cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                        <h2>react fundamentals<sup>Chapter 3</sup></h2>
                        <p>React Native runs on <ins>React</ins>, a popular open source library for building user
                            interfaces with
                            JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
                            section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                        </p>
                        <p>We&rsquo;re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                        <p><b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
                            friendly,
                            approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                        <p><b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
                            JavaScript like so: <mark>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;.</mark></p>
                        <p>The React docs have <ins>comprehensive guide to JSX</ins> you can refer to learn even more.
                            Because
                            JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                            <mark>name</mark> for the
                            cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <mark>&lt;Text&gt;</mark>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for &ldquo;properties&rdquo;.</p>
                        <p><b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
                            render, state is like a component&rsquo;s personal data storage. State is useful for
                            handling data
                            that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components
                            memory!</p>

                    <section id="handling">
                        <h2>handling text input<sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>
                        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                            <i>onChangeText</i> prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and
                            an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say that as the user types, you&rsquo;re translating their words
                            into a
                            different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So
                            the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as &quot;üçï üçï&quot;.</p>
